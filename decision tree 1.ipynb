    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression \n",
    "tasks. It is a simple yet powerful algorithm that works by partitioning the input data into subsets based on a series of \n",
    "decision rules. These decision rules are represented as a tree-like structure, where each internal node represents a decision\n",
    "based on a feature, each branch represents an outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a class label (in the\n",
    "case of classification) or a numerical value (in the case of regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the decision tree classifier algorithm works to make predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Data Splitting: The algorithm starts by considering all the data in the training set as the root node of the tree. It then\n",
    "  looks for the feature that best separates the data into two or more subsets. The \"best\" feature is typically determined\n",
    "based on criteria like Gini impurity or information gain (for classification) or mean squared error reduction (for\n",
    "regression). These criteria quantify how well a feature splits the data into more homogeneous subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Splitting Criteria: The chosen feature and its splitting threshold are used to create child nodes. The data points are\n",
    "  divided into subsets based on whether they meet the condition defined by the selected feature and threshold. For example, \n",
    "if we're classifying animals as \"mammals\" or \"non-mammals,\" one possible split might be based on the presence of fur.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Recursion: The algorithm then recursively applies the splitting process to each child node. This continues until one of\n",
    "  the stopping criteria is met, such as reaching a predefined depth, having a certain number of data points in a node, or\n",
    "achieving pure leaves (all data points in a leaf node belong to the same class).\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Leaf Node Assignment: When the recursion stops, each leaf node is assigned a class label (in classification) or a\n",
    "  predicted value (in regression). For classification, the class label assigned to a leaf node is typically the majority\n",
    "class of the training examples in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Prediction: To make predictions for new data, you traverse the decision tree from the root node down to a leaf node based \n",

    "is then assigned as the predicted outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees have several advantages, including simplicity, interpretability, and the ability to handle both categorical\n",
    "and numerical data. However, they are prone to overfitting when the tree is too deep and can create complex models that\n",

    "\n",
    "1.Selecting the Best Split: The decision tree algorithm starts by selecting the feature and value that best splits the data\n",
    "  into two groups. This is done by finding the split that maximizes the information gain or minimizes the impurity (e.g.,\n",
    "Gini impurity or entropy). Geometrically, this is equivalent to finding a line (for 2D data) that best separates the two \n",

    "  the majority class of the data points within that leaf. Geometrically, this means that each leaf node corresponds to a\n",
    "region in the feature space, and the predicted class within that region is the majority class of the training data points\n",

    "splits made by the tree. In our 2D example, these decision boundaries are straight lines (since we're splitting based on \n",

    "Choosing an appropriate evaluation metric for a classification problem is crucial because it directly impacts how you assess\n",
    "the performance of your model and make decisions about its effectiveness in solving a particular task. The choice of metric\n",

    "important considerations and steps to guide you in selecting the right evaluation metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Understand the Problem Domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Gain a deep understanding of the problem you are trying to solve. What are the implications of false positives and \n",
    "     false negatives in your specific domain? Different applications may prioritize precision, recall, or a balance between \n",
    "    the two.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Know the Class Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Examine the distribution of classes in your dataset. Imbalanced datasets, where one class significantly outnumbers the\n",
    "     other, can influence the choice of metrics. For imbalanced datasets, accuracy may not be informative, and you might\n",
    "    need to focus on other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic \n",
    "    (ROC-AUC).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.Define Your Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Clearly define your goals and what you want to achieve with the classification model. Are you aiming for high precision,\n",
    "     high recall, or a trade-off between the two? For example:\n",
    "        ~If you are building a spam email filter, you may prioritize precision to minimize false positives (legitimate emails \n",

    "6.Perform Cross-Validation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to evaluate your model's performance across multiple splits of your\n",
    "     dataset. This provides a more robust estimate of how well your model generalizes.\n",
    "        \n",
    "7.Consider Trade-Offs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Be aware of the trade-offs between different metrics. Improving one metric (e.g., precision) might negatively impact\n",
    "     another (e.g., recall). It's essential to strike the right balance for your specific use case.\n",
    "        \n",
    "8.Utilize Domain Expertise:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~Consult with domain experts or stakeholders who have a deep understanding of the problem. They can provide valuable\n",
    "     insights into which metrics are most meaningful for your application.\n",

    "9.Monitor Model Performance Over Time:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ~After deploying your model, continuously monitor its performance in a real-world setting. If the importance of certain\n",
    "     model outcomes changes or if data distributions shift, you may need to adapt your choice of metrics accordingly.\n",
    "        \n",
    "In summary, the choice of an appropriate evaluation metric is not a one-size-fits-all decision. It should be made by\n",
    "considering the problem's context, class distribution, objectives, and constraints. By carefully selecting the right metric,\n",
    "you can ensure that your classification model is evaluated in a way that aligns with the goals of your project and provides\n",

    "\n",
    "1.High Stakes and Consequences: The disease in question is rare but severe, with potentially life-threatening consequences \n",
    "  if left undiagnosed. Therefore, the cost of a false negative (i.e., failing to diagnose a patient who actually has the\n",
    "disease) is extremely high, potentially leading to severe health issues or even death.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Minimizing False Positives: While false negatives are costly, false positives (incorrectly diagnosing a patient with the \n",

    "emotional distress for patients and their families, and additional healthcare costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Precision Prioritizes Accuracy: Precision is a metric that emphasizes the accuracy of positive predictions. In this \n",

    "unnecessary treatments and anxiety for those who are falsely classified as positive.\n",

    "Mathematically, precision is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "            Precision= TruePositives / TruePositives+FalsePositives\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's why recall is the most important metric in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.High Stakes and Critical Timing: In search and rescue operations, the primary goal is to save lives. Time is of the\n",
    "  essence, and finding missing persons quickly can be a matter of life or death. Therefore, the focus is on minimizing \n",
    "false negatives (i.e., failing to locate someone who is actually missing) because every missed individual poses a\n",
    "significant risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Minimizing False Negatives: False negatives in this context represent individuals who are still missing but were\n",
    "  incorrectly classified as \"found.\" Failing to locate a missing person when they are in distress can have dire\n",
    "consequences, including exposure to harsh weather conditions, injuries, or dehydration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Recall Prioritizes Sensitivity: Recall, also known as sensitivity or the true positive rate, measures the ability of the\n",
    "  model to identify all actual positive cases. In this case, a high recall means that the model is effective at finding\n",

    "While precision is also a valuable metric in many classification problems, in this specific case, achieving a perfect\n",
    "precision (i.e., being overly conservative in labeling someone as \"found\") may lead to significant delays in rescue\n",
